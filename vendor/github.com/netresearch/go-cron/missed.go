// MissedPolicy defines how to handle jobs that were scheduled to run
// while the scheduler was not running (e.g., application restart).
//
// This feature requires the user to provide the last run time via WithPrev().
// The scheduler does NOT persist state - users are responsible for storing
// and loading last run times from their own persistence layer.
//
// Important interactions:
//   - WithRunOnce: Run-once jobs skip catch-up to avoid unintended duplicate runs
//   - SkipIfStillRunning wrapper: With MissedRunAll, catch-up jobs start nearly
//     simultaneously, so most may be skipped. Use MissedRunOnce for predictable behavior.
//
// Example usage:
//
//	// Load last run time from your database
//	lastRun := loadFromDatabase("daily-report")
//
//	c.AddFunc("0 9 * * *", dailyReport,
//	    cron.WithPrev(lastRun),                      // When it last ran
//	    cron.WithMissedPolicy(cron.MissedRunOnce),   // Run once if missed
//	    cron.WithMissedGracePeriod(2*time.Hour),     // Only if within 2 hours
//	)
