# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

Originally based on [robfig/cron](https://github.com/robfig/cron).

## [Unreleased]

### Planned for v2
- Context-aware Job interface with graceful shutdown support

## [0.14.0] - 2026-04-16

### Added
- **`RunJob` helper** ([#355], [PR#356]): Exported `RunJob(ctx, job)` dispatches to
  `JobWithContext.RunWithContext(ctx)` or `Job.Run()` automatically. Intended for
  custom `JobWrapper` implementations so they don't need to reimplement the
  type-switch. The internal `startJobWithExecution` in `cron.go` now uses `RunJob`
  to consolidate the duplicated dispatch logic.

### Fixed
- **FakeClock `BlockUntil` missed-wakeup race** ([#357], [PR#358]): The channel-based
  waiter list had a classic missed-wakeup race — if a timer was created between the
  mutex unlock and channel receive in `BlockUntil`, the notification was lost and the
  caller hung indefinitely. Replaced with `sync.Cond` where `Wait()` atomically
  releases the mutex and sleeps, guaranteeing no missed broadcasts. Also removed the
  redundant `fired` field from `fakeTimer`.

### Changed
- **CI: org workflow references** ([PR#359]): Reusable workflows from
  `netresearch/.github` now reference `@main` instead of SHA-pinned commits,
  so upstream improvements propagate automatically.
- **Toolchain** ([PR#360]): Updated from `go1.25.5` to `go1.26.2` (minimum `go 1.25`
  unchanged).
- **DST documentation** ([PR#354]): Added industry context and references (POSIX,
  ISC cron, systemd, Kubernetes CronJob) to DST handling docs.

## [0.13.4] - 2026-04-02

### Fixed
- **DST fall-back duplicate execution** ([#349], [PR#350]): Jobs scheduled during DST
  fall-back transitions (when wall-clock time repeats) no longer fire twice. The
  scheduler detects when `Next()` returns the second occurrence of the same wall-clock
  time and skips it, consistent with ISC cron behavior and ADR-016.
- **Hash expression false positive on day names** ([PR#347]): Day-of-week names
  containing "H" (e.g., `THU`) no longer incorrectly trigger hash expression
  validation, which previously caused valid expressions like `0 0 * * THU` to fail.
- **SLSA provenance format** ([PR#345]): Fixed provenance subject format and flaky
  example test.
- **Supply chain hardening** ([PR#348]): SHA-pinned all GitHub Actions and added
  Dependabot for actions updates.
- **Release attestation** ([PR#353]): Migrated to shared reusable workflows; fixed
  broken attestation by removing unpinned transitive dependency.

### Changed
- Rebranded from "maintained fork" to standalone project ([PR#344]).

[PR#344]: https://github.com/netresearch/go-cron/pull/344

## [0.13.1] - 2026-03-08

### Fixed
- **Race condition in `Entry`/`EntryByName` and `ScheduleJob`** ([PR#336]): When the
  scheduler is running, `Entry`/`EntryByName` now route lookups through the run loop
  channel while holding `runningMu`, preventing concurrent map access. `ScheduleJob`
  now routes through the `c.add` channel when running, ensuring all heap/map
  modifications happen atomically in the run loop. `Entry`, `EntryByName`, and
  `Entries` now return struct copies with cloned `Tags` slices, preventing
  callers from mutating internal scheduler state.

[PR#336]: https://github.com/netresearch/go-cron/pull/336

## [0.13.0] - 2026-02-23

### Added
- **Quoted timezone values** ([#335], [PR#337]): Shell users can now write
  `TZ="America/New_York"` or `TZ='UTC'` in cron spec strings. Matching single
  or double quotes are stripped before validation.

[#335]: https://github.com/netresearch/go-cron/issues/335
[PR#337]: https://github.com/netresearch/go-cron/pull/337

## [0.12.0] - 2026-02-17

### Added
- **`PauseEntry`/`ResumeEntry`** ([#203], [PR#323]): Temporarily suspend individual
  entries without removing them. Paused entries remain in the scheduler with their
  schedule advancing, but execution is skipped. Includes `ByName` variants,
  `IsEntryPaused`/`IsEntryPausedByName` query methods, `WithPaused()` JobOption,
  and exported `Entry.Paused` field visible in snapshots.
- **Triggered jobs** ([#311], [PR#325]): Jobs that never fire automatically, only when
  explicitly triggered. Register with `@triggered`, `@manual`, or `@none` descriptors,
  then execute on demand via `TriggerEntry`/`TriggerEntryByName`. Includes
  `TriggeredSchedule` type, `IsTriggered()` helper, exported `Entry.Triggered` field,
  `ErrEntryPaused`/`ErrNotRunning` sentinel errors, and compatibility with all existing
  features (middleware, context, pause/resume, run-once, observability hooks).
- **CircuitBreaker state monitoring** ([#185], [PR#326]): `CircuitBreakerWithHandle()`
  returns a `*CircuitBreakerHandle` for querying state (`State()`, `Failures()`,
  `LastFailure()`, `CooldownEnds()`). `WithStateChangeCallback()` option emits events
  on state transitions (Closed→Open, Open→HalfOpen, HalfOpen→Closed, HalfOpen→Open).
- **RetryWithBackoff/RetryOnError attempt callback** ([#186], [PR#326]):
  `WithRetryCallback()` option invokes a callback after each attempt with
  `RetryAttempt` metadata (attempt number, delay, error/panic value, whether another
  retry will follow).
- **Rate limiting middleware** ([#167], [PR#327]): `MaxConcurrent(n)` limits total
  concurrent job executions across all wrapped entries (wait for slot).
  `MaxConcurrentSkip(logger, n)` skips execution when full.
- **`PrevN` schedule introspection** ([#297], [PR#328]): Query the previous n execution
  times for any schedule implementing `ScheduleWithPrev`. Returns times in reverse
  chronological order. Complements the existing `NextN`, `Between`, `Count`, and
  `Matches` introspection functions.
- **Workflow/DAG dependencies** ([#312], [PR#330]):
  - `AddDependency`/`AddDependencyByName` — wire dependency edges between entries
  - `RemoveDependency`/`RemoveDependencyByName` — remove dependency edges
  - `Dependencies`/`DependenciesByName` — query dependency edges for an entry
  - `NewWorkflow`/`AddWorkflow` — declarative workflow builder with `Step`, `After`, `Final`
  - `WorkflowStatus`/`ActiveWorkflows` — query workflow execution state
  - `WorkflowExecutionID` — extract execution ID from job context
  - `WithWorkflowRetention` — configure completed execution retention count
  - 4 trigger conditions: `OnSuccess`, `OnFailure`, `OnSkipped`, `OnComplete`
  - `OnWorkflowComplete` observability hook
- **CodSpeed continuous benchmarking** ([PR#333])

### Fixed
- **Recover workflow-awareness** ([PR#331]): `Recover` wrapper now re-panics in
  workflow context so the workflow engine correctly detects job failures.
- **Workflow shutdown hang** ([PR#331]): `Stop()` no longer hangs when workflow jobs
  are in flight. The `jobDone` send is now non-blocking when the entry context is
  canceled, preventing goroutines from blocking forever after the run loop exits.
- **Workflow state isolation** ([PR#331]): `WorkflowStatus` and `ActiveWorkflows` now
  return deep copies of workflow execution state, preventing callers from mutating
  internal scheduler maps.
- **Multi-condition dependency removal** ([PR#331]): `RemoveDependency` now correctly
  removes all edges between a parent-child pair (e.g., `OnSuccess` + `OnFailure`),
  not just the first match. Also fixed in `removeEntry` cleanup.

## [0.11.0] - 2026-02-12

### Added
- **`UpdateEntry`/`UpdateEntryByName`** ([#313], [PR#314]): Atomically replace both
  schedule and job function of an existing entry. The new job is re-wrapped through
  the configured Chain. Useful when rescheduling requires a new closure (e.g.,
  `context.WithCancel` per schedule change). Returns `ErrNilJob` if job is nil.
- **Per-entry context** ([PR#315]): Each entry now has its own `context.Context` derived
  from the Cron's base context. Jobs implementing `JobWithContext` receive this per-entry
  context instead of the shared base context. The entry context is automatically canceled
  when the entry is removed or when its job is replaced via `UpdateEntry`. Schedule-only
  updates (`UpdateSchedule`) do not cancel the context. `Stop()` cancels the base
  context, which cascades to all entry contexts.
- **`UpdateEntryJob`/`UpdateEntryJobByName`** ([PR#315]): Convenience methods that parse
  a spec string with the Cron's configured parser, then atomically replace both schedule
  and job. Eliminates the need for callers to construct their own parser matching the
  Cron's configuration.
- **Context-propagating chain wrappers** ([PR#316]): All chain wrappers (`Recover`,
  `DelayIfStillRunning`, `SkipIfStillRunning`, `Timeout`, `Jitter`,
  `JitterWithLogger`) now implement `JobWithContext` and propagate the incoming
  context to inner jobs that also implement `JobWithContext`. Previously, only
  `TimeoutWithContext` propagated context; other wrappers returned `FuncJob`
  which broke the context chain. This means per-entry context now flows through
  the entire wrapper chain to context-aware jobs.
- **`UpsertJob`** ([PR#316]): Create-or-update convenience method that combines `AddJob`
  and `UpdateEntry` into a single call. Requires `WithName` option. If an entry with
  the name exists, its schedule and job are atomically updated; otherwise a new
  entry is created. Handles TOCTOU races via retry. Returns `ErrNameRequired` if
  no name is provided.
- **`WaitForJob`/`WaitForJobByName`** ([#317], [PR#318]): Block until all
  currently-running invocations of an entry complete. Returns immediately if the entry
  is not running or does not exist. Enables graceful job replacement without manual
  WaitGroup tracking: `cr.WaitForJobByName("job"); cr.UpsertJob(...)`. Per-entry
  tracking uses a mutex-protected counter on each entry, wired into `startJob`.
- **`IsJobRunning`/`IsJobRunningByName`** ([PR#319]): Non-blocking query to check
  whether an entry has any invocations currently in flight. Useful for monitoring
  dashboards and conditional logic (e.g., skip waiting if not running).

## [0.10.0] - 2026-02-08

### Added
- **`WithCapacity(n)`** ([#287], [PR#290]): Pre-allocate internal data structures for
  known workload sizes.
- **`WithMissedPolicy()`** ([#296], [PR#303]): Catch-up policy for jobs that missed
  their scheduled time while the scheduler was stopped.
- **`RetryOnError()`** ([PR#306]): Error-based retry middleware — retries when a job
  returns an error (complements `RetryWithBackoff` which retries on panics).
- **`UpdateSchedule()`/`UpdateScheduleByName()`** ([PR#307]): Atomically replace an
  entry's schedule at runtime without removing and re-adding.
- **`UpdateJob()`/`UpdateJobByName()`** ([PR#309]): Atomically replace an entry's job
  function at runtime.
- **`ValidateSpecWith()`/`Cron.ValidateSpec()`** ([PR#308]): Rich validation API that
  returns structured analysis without creating a schedule.

## [0.9.1] - 2026-01-17

### Added
- **DOM/DOW AND logic warnings** ([#277], [PR#285]): Runtime notification when both day-of-month
  and day-of-week are restricted, helping users understand AND logic behavior
  - `SpecAnalysis.Warnings` field for programmatic inspection via `AnalyzeSpec()`
  - Cron-level logger emits info message when scheduling affected jobs
  - Warnings suppressed when `DowOrDom` option is used (legacy OR behavior)

### Documentation
- **ADR-008** ([PR#284]): Architecture decision record documenting DOM/DOW AND logic rationale
- Improved breaking change visibility in README, CHANGELOG, and MIGRATION.md ([PR#282])
- Fixed version reference in RetryWithBackoff migration guide ([PR#283])

[PR#283]: https://github.com/netresearch/go-cron/pull/283
[PR#284]: https://github.com/netresearch/go-cron/pull/284
[PR#285]: https://github.com/netresearch/go-cron/pull/285

## [0.9.0] - 2026-01-16

> [!WARNING]
> **Breaking change:** DOM/DOW matching now uses AND logic by default.
> See [MIGRATION.md](docs/MIGRATION.md#domdow-and-logic-277) for details and the `DowOrDom` legacy option.

### Changed
- **BREAKING: DOM/DOW matching now uses AND logic** ([#277], [PR#279]): When both day-of-month
  and day-of-week are specified, both must match. This is consistent with all other cron fields
  and enables useful patterns:
  - `0 0 25-31 * FRI` = last Friday of month
  - `0 0 1-7 * MON` = first Monday of month
  - `0 0 13 * FRI` = Friday the 13th
  - Use `DowOrDom` parser option for legacy OR behavior

### Added
- **Wraparound ranges** ([#276], [PR#278]): Cyclic fields now support ranges where start > end
  - Hours: `22-2` spans midnight (22, 23, 0, 1, 2)
  - Day-of-week: `FRI-MON` spans weekend (FRI, SAT, SUN, MON)
  - Month: `NOV-FEB` spans year boundary (NOV, DEC, JAN, FEB)
  - Supports step values: `22-2/2` = every 2 hours from 10pm to 2am
- **`DowOrDom` parser option** ([#277], [PR#279]): Legacy OR mode for DOM/DOW matching
  - Provides robfig/cron compatibility for users depending on OR behavior

### Fixed
- **Test reliability** ([PR#278]): Fixed flaky chain tests using channel synchronization

[PR#278]: https://github.com/netresearch/go-cron/pull/278
[PR#279]: https://github.com/netresearch/go-cron/pull/279

## [0.8.0] - 2025-12-26

### Added
- **`FullParser()` convenience function** ([PR#266]): Pre-configured parser with all features enabled
  (seconds, year, hash, extended syntax)
- **`YearOptional` parser option** ([PR#266]): Auto-detect year field by value >= 100

### Changed
- **Security hardening**: Improved workflow permissions and branch protection documentation

### Documentation
- Updated changelog with v0.7.1 contributor attribution

[PR#266]: https://github.com/netresearch/go-cron/pull/266

## [0.7.1] - 2025-12-17

### Fixed
- **Synchronize add/remove operations while cron is running** ([#262], [PR#264]): Fixed race condition
  when adding or removing jobs while the scheduler is running. Operations now use synchronous
  request/reply channels to ensure completion before returning. Thanks to [@jrouzierinverse] for
  the contribution!
- **Test reliability**: Fixed flaky `TestRunOnce_AddWhileRunning` test using polling instead of
  sleep, with increased timeout for Windows CI

### Changed
- **CI: Skip gitleaks on fork PRs**: Fork PRs now pass CI without requiring secrets, as GitHub
  Actions doesn't expose secrets to forks for security reasons

## [0.7.0] - 2025-12-16

### Added
- **Extended cron syntax** ([#224], [#225], [PR#259]): Quartz/Jenkins-style modifiers as opt-in parser options
  - `#n` nth weekday of month (e.g., `FRI#3` = 3rd Friday) — see [`ExampleDowNth`]
  - `#L` last weekday of month (e.g., `FRI#L` = last Friday)

  - Useful for missed job detection — see [`ExampleScheduleWithPrev_Prev_detectMissed`]
- **Entry options** ([#221], [PR#245]): Fine-grained entry control
  - `WithPrev` stores previous run time — see [`ExampleWithPrev`]

## [0.6.1] - 2025-12-03

### Changed
- **Go toolchain**: Updated from go1.25.0 to go1.25.5
- **CodeQL action**: Upgraded from v3.28.0 to v4.31.6
- **CodeQL workflow**: Added explicit workflow file for shields.io badge compatibility

## [0.6.0] - 2025-12-03

### Breaking Changes
- **RetryWithBackoff semantics**: `maxRetries=0` now means "no retries" (execute once, fail on panic).
  Previously `0` meant unlimited retries, which was a DoS risk.
  - **Migration**: Use `maxRetries=-1` for unlimited retries (explicit opt-in)
  - **Rationale**: Zero-value safety - forgotten configs now fail-fast instead of retrying forever

### Added
- **Min-heap scheduling**: O(log n) insertion/removal, O(1) next job lookup (upstream PR #423)
- **Index map compaction**: Automatic cleanup of index maps after frequent entry removals
- **WithClock option**: Inject custom time source for deterministic testing
- **WithMaxSearchYears option**: Configure how many years schedule matching searches before giving up
- **WithLogLevel option for Recover**: Configure log level (Error/Info) for recovered panics
- **WithMinEveryInterval option**: Configure minimum interval for `@every` expressions
  - Allow sub-second intervals for testing: `WithMinEveryInterval(0)` or `WithMinEveryInterval(100*time.Millisecond)`
  - Enforce longer minimums for rate limiting: `WithMinEveryInterval(time.Minute)`
- **EveryWithMin function**: Create constant delay schedules with custom minimum interval
- **Parser.WithMinEveryInterval**: Configure minimum interval on parser level
- **StandardParser function**: Get a copy of the standard parser for customization
- **StopWithTimeout**: Graceful shutdown with configurable timeout
- **StopAndWait**: Convenience method for blocking until all jobs complete
- **Context support**: `JobWithContext` interface and `WithContext` option
- **Job metadata**: `WithName` and `WithTags` options for job identification
- **RetryWithBackoff wrapper**: Exponential backoff retry for transient failures
- **CircuitBreaker wrapper**: Prevent cascading failures with automatic recovery
- **WithMaxEntries option**: Limit maximum entries to prevent memory exhaustion
- **Observability hooks**: `WithObservability` option for metrics integration
- **TryNewParser/MustNewParser**: Safe and panic-on-error parser constructors
- **Timeout callback**: Optional callback when job times out
- **Benchmark suite**: Comprehensive benchmark tests for parser, scheduler, and job operations
- **CI benchmarks**: CI job to run benchmarks and upload results as artifacts
- **Input validation**: Maximum spec length limit (1024 chars) to prevent DoS
- **Timeout JobWrapper**: `chain.Timeout(duration)` for job execution time limits
- **slog adapter**: `SlogLogger` for structured logging with Go 1.21+ slog
- **Multi-platform CI**: Windows, macOS, and Linux testing
- **ExampleTimeout_withContext**: Demonstrates idiomatic context-based cancellation pattern
- **Fuzz tests**: Fuzz testing for parser and scheduler robustness
- **Enterprise security**: SLSA provenance, gosec, govulncheck, gitleaks, trivy scanning

### Fixed
- **Panic on NewParser with no fields**: Returns error instead of panicking
- **Entry limit race condition**: Use atomic CAS for thread-safe limit checking
- **Flaky tests**: Fixed timing-sensitive tests with channel synchronization
  - `TestChainSkipIfStillRunning`
  - `TestStopAndWait`
  - `TestTimeoutWithContext`
  - `TestFakeClockSchedulerIntegration` subtests
- **Heap corruption**: Prevent stale heapIndex in Update operations
- **Time backwards handling**: Scheduler iterates over copy when time goes backwards
- **EntryID overflow**: Skip EntryID 0 on uint64 overflow

### Changed
- **EntryID uint64**: Changed from `int` to `uint64` for larger job capacity
- **slices package**: Uses Go 1.21+ `slices.SortFunc` and `slices.DeleteFunc`
- **Linting**: Uses golangci-lint v2.6.1 with modern rule set
- **Timeout wrapper logging**: Enhanced message clarifies "goroutine still running in background"
- **Parser complexity reduction**: Extracted helpers for better maintainability
- **safeExecute consolidation**: Unified panic recovery across codebase

### Security
- **Timezone validation**: Character and length restrictions for timezone strings to prevent DoS
- **RetryWithBackoff DoS prevention**: Zero-value is now safe default (no retries vs unlimited)
- **Enterprise-grade CI**: GitHub Actions hardened with SHA pinning and SLSA

## [0.5.0] - 2025-11-25

Initial release of netresearch/go-cron fork.

### Added
- **Step range validation**: Step size must be less than range size (upstream #543)
- **Minimum duration enforcement**: `@every` requires at least 1 second duration
- **DST handling**: ISC cron-compatible behavior for spring forward transitions
- **Time backwards handling**: Scheduler handles system time moving backwards gracefully
- **GitHub Actions CI**: Migrated from Travis CI with comprehensive workflow

### Fixed
- **Panic on nil receiver** (upstream #551): `Entry.Run()` no longer panics
- **Panic on empty timezone** (upstream #554): Parser returns error instead
- **Panic on timezone-only spec** (upstream #555): Parser returns error instead
- **removeEntry optimization**: Pre-allocates slice to reduce allocations
- **SkipIfStillRunning graceful quit**: Fixed jobWrapper cleanup behavior

### Changed
- **Go version**: Requires Go 1.25+
- **Module path**: Changed to `github.com/netresearch/go-cron`
- **Code style**: Applied De Morgan's law optimizations
- **Spelling**: Corrected 'cancelled' to 'canceled' (American English)

### Security
- Integrated gosec, govulncheck, gitleaks, and trivy security scanning

## Differences from upstream robfig/cron

This fork includes all features from robfig/cron v3 plus:

| Feature | robfig/cron | netresearch/go-cron |
|---------|-------------|---------------------|
| Scheduling algorithm | O(n) sort | O(log n) min-heap |
| Custom time source | No | WithClock option |
| Step range validation | No | Yes |
| @every minimum duration | No | 1 second (configurable) |
| Timezone validation | No | Yes |
| Input length limits | No | Yes |
| Timeout wrapper | No | Yes |
| slog adapter | No | Yes |
| EntryID type | int | uint64 |
| DST spring forward | Skips | ISC-compatible |
| Time backwards handling | No | Yes |
| Multi-platform CI | Linux only | Win/Mac/Linux |

## Migration from robfig/cron

1. Update import path:
   ```go
   // Before
   import "github.com/robfig/cron/v3"

   // After
   import "github.com/netresearch/go-cron"
   ```

2. Update `EntryID` usage if storing as `int`:
   ```go
   // Before
   var id int = c.AddJob(...)

   // After
   var id cron.EntryID = c.AddJob(...) // or uint64
   ```

3. Review cron expressions for step validation:
   ```go
   // Now returns error (step >= range size)
   _, err := cron.ParseStandard("*/60 * * * *") // Error: step (60) must be less than range size (60)
   ```
